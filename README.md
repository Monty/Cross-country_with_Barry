# Epic 1963 cross-country road trip
When we graduated from high school, four of us celebrated by taking
a 21-day trip across the US.

My friend Barry Connor organized the trip. He drove the entire trip,
sometimes covering over 700 miles in a single day. We took his red
1961 Ford Starliner with a 390 cubic inch big block V-8 that he
sometimes raced at Tampa Dragway.

Our trip was written up in the local newspaper after we returned. I
scanned the article and converted it into a text file since the
scanned image was difficult to read.
